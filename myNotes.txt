copied from medium : "Pagination, also known as paging, divides a document into distinct pages,
                      whether electronic or printed. This crucial technique enhances web application speed,
                      user experience, and resource efficiency. By breaking content into manageable sections,
                      pagination facilitates faster loading, smoother navigation, and bandwidth conservation.
                      It optimizes server performance, aids in SEO, and is essential for scalability, ensuring
                      effective management of large datasets."
